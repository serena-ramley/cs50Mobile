### 3a-objectMutation.js

Copy an object by reference:

const o2 = o

Copy an object by value:

const o3 = Object.assign({}, o)

When printing an object combined with another message, use commas and not +
console.log("My object: ", o)

### 3b-deepCopy.js

Create a new, empty object. For every key in an inputted object, if the val is also an object, recursively try to deep copy this nested object until a non-object value is reached. Else, if a val is not an object, copy it into the keys of the new object. Once all of the keys have been iterated through, return the new object
